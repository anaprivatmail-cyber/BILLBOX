      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <div class="meta">Last updated: 2026-01-23</div>

      <p>
        These Terms govern your use of the Billbox mobile app and related services (the “Service”).
        By using the Service, you agree to these Terms and the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        For support or legal inquiries, contact <a href="mailto:info@getbillbox.com">info@getbillbox.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Use of the Service</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for the accuracy of information you enter or upload.</li>
        <li>You may not use the Service for illegal activities or to harm the Service or others.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Content and disclaimers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Service helps you store and organize bills and warranty information. It does not provide legal, tax, or accounting advice.</li>
        <li>The Service is provided “as is” and “as available”. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Paid features and subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Some features may require a paid subscription. Subscription pricing, renewal, cancellation, and refunds are handled by the platform where you purchased
        (Apple App Store / Google Play) or by the relevant payment provider if you purchased on the web.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can cancel at any time through the store or payment provider where you subscribed.</li>
        <li>After cancellation, your paid access continues until the end of the current billing period.</li>
        <li>If a payment fails or a subscription expires, paid features may be suspended and your account may be downgraded to the free tier after any applicable grace period.</li>
        <li>Refunds are handled by the platform or payment provider, except where mandatory law requires otherwise.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Access after cancellation or non-payment</h2>
      <p>
        When a subscription ends (cancellation or payment failure), access to paid features continues until the end of the current billing period and then stops.
        Your account remains available on the free tier.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Paid features (for example additional profiles, advanced exports, or higher OCR limits) are disabled once the subscription expires.</li>
        <li>Your existing data remains available in the app, subject to the free-tier limits.</li>
        <li>Export tools are available only while your active plan includes exports.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Data retention is described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>Termination and account deletion</h2>
      <p>
        You may stop using the Service at any time. You can request deletion of your account and associated personal data as described on
        <a href="/account-deletion">Account Deletion</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. The “Last updated” date indicates when changes were made.
